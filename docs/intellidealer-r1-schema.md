# IntelliDealerR1 — Schema Reference

A separate Azure SQL database that contains a **much wider replica of the Intellidealer source schema** than the production [acctdata](data-model.md) DB. The data in IntelliDealerR1 is stale (paused since Dec 2025), but the schema itself is verified-accurate and can be used as the design spec for expanding our replication coverage.

## TL;DR

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Server** | `crystal-intellidealer-r1.database.windows.net` |
| **Database** | `IntelliDealerR1` (paused, serverless — auto-resumes on connect) |
| **Resource group** | `IntellidealerR1` |
| **Max size** | 64 GB |
| **Auth** | SQL: `crystalSQL` / `M4thrules2024!` ⚠️ **2024!** not 2025! (different from CrystalCares server) |
| **AAD admin** | `ted.uiterwyk@crystalmotorcarco.onmicrosoft.com` — `brad.greenway@me.com` is **not granted**, AAD auth fails |
| **Tables** | 203 in `dbo` |
| **Data freshness** | Paused 2025-12-11 — **5+ months stale**. Use for schema only, not numbers. |
| **Status** | Currently **Online** (was resumed during 2026-05-19 investigation). Should be re-paused when not in use to stop billing. |

Companion app that uses this server: `CrystalTradeInFunctions`. Its `SQLServerConnectionString` app-setting was the source of the correct password.

## Why we trust the schema

When IntelliDealerR1 was paused (2025-12-11), the **acctdata** production replica continued refreshing. Today (2026-05-19), the 4 tables present in both DBs compare column-for-column, type-for-type:

| Table | IDR1 cols | acctdata cols (excl. ETL trailer) | Difference |
|-------|-----------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| ACCMAST | 14 | 14 | none |
| COACMAST | 51 | 51 | none |
| DEPTMAST | 33 | 33 | none |
| GLCAL | 9 | 9 | none |

5 months elapsed → zero schema drift. Intellidealer is a mature Db2-for-i ERP and schema changes are rare. **Reliable for schema design.** *(GLFIS is in acctdata but not IDR1 — coverage difference, not drift.)*

## What is STILL not available even in IntelliDealerR1

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| **No wholegoods / equipment unit master (`WG*`, `MACH*`, `EQUIP*`)** | Per-unit days-on-lot, per-unit margin, used-equipment book/market analysis remain blocked. **Possibly named differently in source** — worth a targeted search in Intellidealer docs. |
| **No rental tables (`RE*`, `RNT*`)** | Rental fleet utilization and per-asset rental P&L remain blocked. **Possibly Crystal doesn't run a rental program**, in which case this isn't a gap. Worth confirming. |
| **No budget / forecast tables** | Budget vs Actual remains blocked. Crystal likely manages these in Excel — separate sourcing required. |
| **No GLTRANS / journal-entry line detail** — RE-CORRECTED 2026-05-31 | Per the **Intellidealer 6.0 System Flowchart** (in `docs/Intellidealer system flow chart.pdf`), the canonical journal-line table is **`YTDJRL` (Year-to-Date Journals)** — it sits alongside `GLCAL`, `GLFIS`, and `SUBLED` in the GL module. **`YTDJRL` does NOT exist in IDR1** (verified 2026-05-31 by direct query). It exists on the live AS/400 source but was never replicated. An earlier 2026-05-29 note in this doc incorrectly claimed the journal-line data was distributed across five sub-system tables (`CGIHIST`, `YTDIST`, `SUBLED`, `PARTHIST`, `INVHCC`) — that was the result of trying to reverse-engineer the gap from what IDR1 *did* have. Reconciliation against GLCAL on those five tables only reached ~80% of revenue, ~84% of COGS, ~26% of OpEx, and ~10% of BS activity. **The correct ask is to replicate `YTDJRL` from the source** — a single table, not five. |
| **Several other accounting tables also missing from IDR1** — discovered 2026-05-31 | The flowchart shows these tables in the accounting module, but they are NOT in IDR1: `YTDJRL` (Journals), `IEHIST` (Individual Earnings History / payroll), `FASSET`/`FADEPR`/`FAHIST` (Fixed Asset Master / Depreciation), `GBD` (General Billing Details), `MNBDD` / `MNBDT` (Invoice Details / WO & Unit Info), `CRDEP` (Cash Receipts Batches), plus `APDISC`, `RETCOD`, `GLBUD`, `COACBUDS`, `COACALIS`, `GCDES`, `DOCACCT`. IDR1 is a partial replica — its 203 tables cover ~70% of the Intellidealer schema, NOT the whole thing. When the flowchart references a table, check existence in IDR1 before assuming we have it. |
| **No A/P sub-ledger or vendor master** | Only 2 thin AP-control tables (`APBAT` 9 rows, `APPSCH` 141 rows). No `APMAST` / `APHIST` / `VENDOR` tables. A/P aging by vendor / invoice remains blocked. `POBILL` is a partial proxy. |
| **No GLFIS in IDR1** | Annual rollup is only in the current acctdata replica. |

## Reporting impact

Catalog from [reporting-catalog.md](reporting-catalog.md) coverage, by source:

| Source | Coverage | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Current 5 tables (acctdata) | ~70% | All P&L, BS, trial balance, departmental, alias rollups, ratios |
| + Tables visible in IDR1 (once replicated) | **~90%** | Adds A/R aging, parts margin per SKU, service labor analysis, customer profitability, sales transaction detail, bank rec, audit |
| Remaining gaps | ~10% | Budget vs Actual, JE-line detail, wholegoods-unit detail, rental, full A/P |

## Connection recipe

```python
import pyodbc
conn = pyodbc.connect(
    "DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};"
    "SERVER=tcp:crystal-intellidealer-r1.database.windows.net,1433;"
    "DATABASE=IntelliDealerR1;UID=crystalSQL;PWD=M4thrules2024!;"
    "Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=60", timeout=60)
```

⚠️ **Cold-start: first connection triggers auto-resume**, can take 30–90 seconds (returns SQL error 40613 until ready). Either retry the connection or poll `az sql db show … --query status` until it returns `Online`.

⚠️ **Firewall:** add an explicit IP rule before connecting:
```bash
export PATH="/c/Program Files/Microsoft SDKs/Azure/CLI2/wbin:$PATH"
az sql server firewall-rule create \
  --resource-group IntellidealerR1 --server crystal-intellidealer-r1 \
  --name "claude-$(date +%Y%m%d)" \
  --start-ip-address $(curl -s ifconfig.me) --end-ip-address $(curl -s ifconfig.me)
```

⚠️ **Re-pause when done** to stop billing:
```bash
az sql db pause --resource-group IntellidealerR1 --server crystal-intellidealer-r1 --name IntelliDealerR1
```

---

## Recommended path forward

1. **Use IDR1 schema as the design spec** for any new query / report / agent that needs tables beyond the 5 we currently replicate.
2. **Extend the AcctLoadControl ETL** (same pattern as the 5 GL tables) to replicate high-value tables into a fresh DB (acctdata or new). Priorities:
   - A/R: `ARFILE`, `ARSTHD`, `ARSTHH`
   - Parts: `PARTMAST`, `PARTHIST`, `PARTPRC` (start; add others as needed)
   - Service: `WOH`, `WOLAB`, `WOTAH`, `WOTTM`
   - Sales: `SALDET`, `SALORD`, `SALCOM`
   - Customer master: `CMAS*` family (select tables based on actual use)
3. **Re-pause IDR1** while not actively using it (auto-pause triggers after idle, but a manual pause is faster).
4. **Source budget data separately** — likely an Excel import.
5. **Investigate Intellidealer source docs** for the actual table names for wholegoods, rental, JE-line-detail, and A/P sub-ledger — they may exist under names we haven't guessed.
